# Hunter's Bestiary Dashboard Standard

Dashboard API version: 1.0.0. The core module is authoritative; this module consumes the same public toolkit.

## Shared interaction structure

Use only relevant sections, in this order where applicable:

1. Window identity and canonical module title.
2. Compact integration/status summary.
3. Tabs or primary navigation.
4. Stable search and filters.
5. Main content.
6. Contextual actions.
7. Import/update/synchronization controls.
8. Diagnostics and validation.
9. Visually separated destructive actions.
10. Status/footer feedback.

Structural consistency does not require irrelevant empty panels. Theme colors may vary through CSS custom properties; interaction semantics may not.

## Required behavior

- ApplicationV2 with a resizable, positioned window.
- Client-scoped persisted width, height, left, and top.
- Viewport clamping before restore.
- Final flush on close.
- Configure Settings menus for **Reset size** and **Reset position**.
- Search that preserves focus and caret by hiding/showing existing entries instead of rerendering the input.
- AbortController-scoped listeners to prevent duplicate handlers after rerender.
- Real progress with phase, counts, percentage, final summary, error details, and conflicting actions disabled.
- Valid DialogV2 button definitions.
- GM-only operations enforced both in the UI and public API.
- Destructive operations limited to exact provenance flags; names alone never prove ownership.
- Localized labels, tooltips, focus states, semantic controls, meaningful empty states, and no color-only meaning.

## ApplicationV2 reference pattern

```javascript
const { ApplicationV2, HandlebarsApplicationMixin } = foundry.applications.api;
const core = game.modules.get("hunters-bestiary")?.api;
await core.whenReady();

const ui = core.ui;
const MODULE_ID = "example-module";
const GEOMETRY_KEY = "dashboardGeometry";

class ExampleDashboard extends HandlebarsApplicationMixin(ApplicationV2) {
  static DEFAULT_OPTIONS = ui.createDashboardOptions({
    id: "example-dashboard",
    classes: ["hb-shared-dashboard", "example-dashboard"],
    title: "Example.Dashboard.Title",
    icon: "fa-solid fa-book",
    width: 960,
    height: 700,
    minWidth: 520,
    minHeight: 380
  });

  #listeners = null;
  #geometry = null;

  async _onFirstRender(context, options) {
    await super._onFirstRender(context, options);
    this.setPosition(ui.loadGeometry({
      moduleId: MODULE_ID,
      settingKey: GEOMETRY_KEY,
      applicationId: this.options.id,
      defaults: this.options.position
    }));
  }

  async _onRender(context, options) {
    await super._onRender(context, options);
    this.#listeners?.abort();
    this.#listeners = new AbortController();
    this.#geometry ??= ui.createGeometryPersistence(this, {
      moduleId: MODULE_ID,
      settingKey: GEOMETRY_KEY,
      applicationId: this.options.id,
      defaults: this.options.position
    });
    ui.bindStableSearch(this.element, {
      inputSelector: "[data-dashboard-search]",
      entrySelector: "[data-dashboard-entry]",
      emptySelector: "[data-dashboard-empty]",
      signal: this.#listeners.signal
    });
  }

  async _preClose(options) {
    this.#listeners?.abort();
    await this.#geometry?.flush();
    this.#geometry?.destroy();
    return super._preClose(options);
  }
}
```

Register `dashboardGeometry` as `scope: "client"`, `config: false`, `type: Object`. Register separate ApplicationV2 settings menus that call `ui.resetSize(...)` and `ui.resetPosition(...)` with the same options. Never store geometry in a world-scoped setting.

## Progress and destructive operations

```javascript
if (!game.user.isGM) throw new Error(game.i18n.localize("Example.Error.GMOnly"));

const confirmed = await ui.confirmDestructiveAction({
  title: game.i18n.localize("Example.Delete.Title"),
  eligible: exactManagedDocuments.map(document => document.name),
  preserved: [game.i18n.localize("Example.Delete.PreservesUserContent")],
  warning: game.i18n.localize("Example.Delete.Warning"),
  confirmLabel: game.i18n.localize("Example.Delete.Confirm")
});
if (!confirmed) return;

await ui.runProgressOperation({
  title: game.i18n.localize("Example.Import.Title"),
  root: dashboard.element,
  runner: async ({ update }) => {
    for (const [index, record] of records.entries()) {
      try {
        await importRecord(record);
        update({ current: index + 1, total: records.length, success: 1, phase: record.name });
      } catch (error) {
        update({ current: index + 1, total: records.length, failed: 1, error, phase: record.name });
      }
    }
  }
});
```

The importer itself must enforce permissions and provenance. A dashboard button is not a security boundary.

## Structural and theme tokens

Structural rules belong to the core `hb-shared-dashboard` layer: spacing, radius, button height, panel padding, typography, focus outline, status badges, progress layout, busy/disabled states, and danger-zone separation.

Complementary modules override only theme custom properties on their own scoped root class, for example:

```css
.example-dashboard {
  --hb-theme-accent: #5aa7c7;
  --hb-theme-background: #071b24;
  --hb-theme-panel: #0d2b37;
  --hb-theme-highlight: #9bd9e8;
  --hb-theme-warning: #e4b86a;
}
```

Do not add broad `button`, `input`, `.window-content`, or ApplicationV2 selectors outside the module root. Do not depend on jQuery. Icon-only controls need localized accessible labels and tooltips.

## This module's application

- Canonical title: **Hunter's Bestiary - D&D 5e 2024**
- Theme retained: High-contrast D&D integration palette
- Shared infrastructure: geometry load/save/clamp/reset, stable search, progress, busy state, result reporting, destructive confirmation where applicable, and dashboard-open naming validation.

## Dashboard and complementary-module compliance checklist

### Naming and manifest

- [ ] Canonical ASCII-apostrophe display title.
- [ ] Stable technical module ID.
- [ ] Correct subject/system order and separators.
- [ ] Exact dependency versions and supported Foundry/system ranges.
- [ ] Naming metadata registered after `core.whenReady()`.
- [ ] Dashboard-open validation called only from the intentional open entry point.

### API and lifecycle

- [ ] Own `whenReady()` always resolves with status, including failure.
- [ ] Required API major versions negotiated.
- [ ] Provider registration validated and rolled back on failure.
- [ ] Compatibility aliases retained and documented.
- [ ] GM-only methods enforce permissions internally.

### Dashboard

- [ ] ApplicationV2, resizable, client geometry, viewport clamp, final close save.
- [ ] Reset size and reset position settings menus.
- [ ] Stable search retains focus/caret and updates empty state.
- [ ] AbortController or equivalent listener cleanup.
- [ ] Shared progress with valid DialogV2 buttons and busy state.
- [ ] Import/update terminology is consistent.
- [ ] Destructive actions are separated, confirmed, provenance-scoped, and reported.
- [ ] Tabs, state changes, and filters avoid unnecessary full rerenders.

### Permissions, secrecy, accessibility

- [ ] Player views exclude GM truth, hidden ecology, provider internals, and destructive actions.
- [ ] Controls are keyboard-operable with visible focus.
- [ ] Semantic labels/tooltips and sufficient contrast.
- [ ] No color-only state communication.
- [ ] English/German localization key parity.

### Engineering and release

- [ ] CSS is rooted under module/shared dashboard classes.
- [ ] No broad global hooks or duplicate listeners.
- [ ] No external images or missing local assets.
- [ ] Existing IDs, flags, settings, and imported Documents migrate without duplication.
- [ ] Automated tests and static validation pass.
- [ ] Repeated builds are byte-identical.
- [ ] Source ZIP reproduces the install ZIP.
- [ ] Live Foundry smoke plan completed or explicitly reported as unavailable.



## Managed-folder migration and deletion

Folder display-name migrations must first identify module-managed Documents through exact flags. A known legacy folder may be renamed only when all contained Documents are managed; otherwise move only managed Documents into the canonical folder and preserve unrelated content. Destructive dashboard actions must be visibly separated, list exact candidate counts, require confirmation, and never use names as ownership evidence.
